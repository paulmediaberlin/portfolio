    "title": "About Me",
    "intro": "My journey into videography started early. After secondary school, I transferred to a film and media school, where I am currently completing my Abitur. Alongside my studies, I gained hands-on experience working for a media agency in Berlin. There, I learned a great deal about professional video production — from planning and shooting to post-production. Today, I realize my own projects and collaborate with clients and personalities such as The Meet Company, Michael Smolik, and ESN athletes. At 19, I independently produce videos, conceptualize projects, and tell stories with a strong focus on authenticity and dynamics.",
